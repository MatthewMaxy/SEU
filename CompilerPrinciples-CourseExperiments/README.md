# Compiler-Principles-Experiments
This project is composed of two experiments I dealt with in my Compiler Principles Course at SEU
+ Lexical Analysis
+ Syntax Analysis
Both of them is designed on mini C++ grammar

The Lexical Analysis can solve almost lexcial analysis works in C++ 

While the Syntax can only solved ifelse, op, bool, loop. It's limited but can calculate First (Follow) Sets and Parsing Table automatically.
